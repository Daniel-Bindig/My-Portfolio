# My Portfolio

## Description

This portfolio is created so that I can display my applications and show any future employers what I am able to create. The portfolio does not currently contain any applications as I am yet to make any, so there are placeholder images in where the applications will go. Whilst creating this application I learnt the importance of using flexbox so that my application is able to be viewed on all screen sizes.

## Usage

To use this application you can click the links at the top to be taken to the appropriate section of the webpage. At the bottom of the screen where the contact information is you are also able to click the "Github" link to be taken to my github profile. In the future when I have applications that I can put on the portfolio you will be able to click the application shown and be taken to it.
